The main objective is to develop a web application that allows obtaining the status of a LAN or WLAN computer network in real time, identifying both its topology and the status parameters of its network devices (eg CPU utilization), providing statistics regarding the analysis of packets directed to the internet by clients.

To do this, it will be necessary to capture all the packets generated by the devices destined for the Internet, obtain information on the connections between devices and consult the status parameters of the network devices. This information must be stored in a database for later viewing focused on the user experience.

Dynamic display functions of the network topology showing its availability, detection of the status of network devices, analysis and classification of packets according to their characteristics, detection of alerts and detection of anomalies are included. 

The system does not perform network device management functions and only considers Ubiquiti Unifi network devices for optimal operation. Non-Ubiquiti Unifi network devices will be detected as clients and not as network devices.

The application is parameterizable, which allows it to be configured in different environments that meet the stated requirements.
